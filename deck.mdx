# What this presentation is about

- some git good practices
- some css good practices
- some accessibility call outs
- some react good practices

---

# Git

---

# Conventional Commits

- Easier parsing and reading a commit history
- Deterministic releases
- Automatic Changelog
- Pride

---

# Conventional Commits Spec

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

---

# Conventional Commits Spec

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

---

# Commitizen

- Command line utility that prompts you for options to format your commits
- It works with conventional commits spec!

---

# How to install

```sh
npm install -g commitizen

npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog

echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
```

# Demo

---

# CSS
---
# Use Flex for Layout

<img src={flex} alt="flex browser support" style={{ height: 500 }}/>

---

# Use REMS for most of things
```css
    .btn {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
```
```css
    .btn {
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
```

---

# Wait, what about EMs?

You can still use them when size is dependant on parent
font size.

E.g Icons

---

# Use Stylelint

- Like ESLint but for CSS
- Prevents most common mistakes
- When not in use: Adhere to the project standards... but at least sort the css properties*

---

# Decide on a naming convention

BEM, OOCSS, smacss, amcss, etc

---

# I like BEM

so we are going to quickly see BEM

---

# Block

```
.human {
    // properties
}
```
---
# Element(s)

```
.human__head {}
```
---
# Modifier(s)
```
.human--tall {}
```
---

# All together
```
.human {}
.human__head {}
.human--tall {}
```
---
# Do not nest more than 1 level
```
// bad
.human__head__eyes {}
// good
.human__eyes
```
---
# Don't use !important
unless you are dealing with 3rd party libraries or developing within a 3rd party

---

# WOFF2 > All other formats
<img src={fontSupport} alt="font support" style={{ height: 200 }}/>

---

# A11Y
Accessibility

---

# alt Text
use 'alt' for images, provide text backing up icons, describe each control

---

# Semantic Elements

- Break up content with subheadings for new sections.
- Mark those headings with HTML header tags.
- Use the correct HTML for all structural elements.
- Use valid HTML everywhere else.
- Use clear labels on forms.

---

# Color

- Do not rely just on color to convey information
- Provide enough contrast on text color


---

# Keyboard navigation

- Use focusable elements
- Try not to write custom elements that resemble native elements (E.g Select)

---

# Test with screen reader

Mac Voice control is a good start

---

# React (quick overview)

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

---

# JSX

```
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

---

# Components and props

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

<Welcome name="billing" />
```

---

# State

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { name: 'foo'}
      this.onClick = this.onClick.bind(this);
  }
  onClick() {
   this.setState({ name: 'bar' })
  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, {this.state.name}</h1>;
            <button onClick={this.onClick}>change</button>
        </div>
    );
  }
}
```
---

# State with Hooks (New)

```
const Welcome = (props) {
    const [name, setName] = useState('foo');
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
            <button onClick={() => { setName('bar')}}>change</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# Advanced APIs

# Context
```
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

---

# Context with hooks
```
const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: "#000000",
    background: "#eeeeee"
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: "#ffffff",
    background: "#222222"
  }
};

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(themes.light);
// Provider is the same way as before
// Consumer changes to this new way
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

---

# Fragments
```
<React.Fragment>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
    <ChildC />
</React.Fragment>

// Short syntax
<>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
    <ChildC />
</>
```

---

# Portals
```
const Modal = props => {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(props.children, document.body);
};

```

---

# Proptypes
```
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    );
  }
}

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
};

```

---

# Advanced React Patterns

---

# Higher Order Components
```
function logProps(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
      console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
      console.log('Next props: ', nextProps);
    }
    render() {
      // Wraps the input component in a container, without mutating it. Good!
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Render Props
```
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { on: false};
  }
  handleToggle() {
      this.setState({
          on: !this.state.on
      });
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.render(this.state);
  }
}
```

---

# Container Components

- Are concerned with how things work.
- Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
- Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.

---

# Presentational Components

- Are concerned with how things look.
- May contain both presentational and container components inside
- Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores.
